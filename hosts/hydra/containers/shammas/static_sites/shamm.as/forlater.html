<p>Hello!</p>

<p>Interesting idea, I like it.</p>

<p>The biggest problem I see is that this is going to (eventually) be used by spammers.</p>

<p>I can send a mail with a FROM anywhere with a link. That link will be advertising for something, and your service will mail it off to some unsuspecting person.</p>

<p>This means your mail server's reputation will end up being black listed everywhere.</p>

<p>Enforcing DKIM/SPF validation would help a lot (but not perfect). I verified that you are not currently doing any validation today. I was able to spoof my gmail address from my residential IP. You do not have very long to fix it before it gets abused. </p>

<p>Proof (and test):</p>

<br />#!/usr/bin/env expect
<br />
<br />set timeout 60
<br />
<br />spawn nc m.forlater.email 25
<br />
<br />expect "220 " { send "EHLO icyphox.sh\r" }
<br />expect "250 HELP" { send "MAIL FROM:&lt;x@icyphox.sh&gt;\r" }
<br />expect "250 2.0.0 Ok" { send "RCPT TO:&lt;save@forlater.email&gt;\r" }
<br />expect "250 2.1.5 Destination address valid: Recipient ok" { send "DATA\r" }
<br />expect "354 " {
<br />  send "FROM: x@icyphox.sh\rTO:save@forlater.email\rSUBJECT: save\r\rhttps://shamm.as/forlater.html\r.\r"
<br />}
<br />expect "250 2.0.0 \w+ Message accepted for delivery" { disconnect }
